# leaky-integrate-and-fire-neuron-LIF
The LIF (Leaky Integrate-and-Fire) model is a simple mathematical model often used to describe the behavior of individual neurons in the brain. The model assumes that the neuron integrates incoming signals, and if the integrated signal reaches a certain threshold, the neuron "fires" and sends an output signal. Additionally, the model includes a leakage term that models the decay of the membrane potential over time.

The equation for the LIF model can be written as:
```math
C \frac{dV}{dt} = -g(V-E) + I(t)
```
where:

* C is the membrane capacitance of the neuron
* V is the membrane potential of the neuron
* g is the conductance of the neuron
* E is the resting potential of the neuron
* I(t) is the input current to the neuron at time t
The equation states that the change in membrane potential over time (dV/dt) is proportional to the difference between the conductance of the neuron times the difference between the membrane potential and the resting potential, minus the input current. This equation can be solved numerically to simulate the behavior of a single neuron.

When the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold, the neuron is assumed to "fire" and send an output signal. At this point, the membrane potential is reset to a lower value, and the neuron enters a brief refractory period during which it cannot fire again.
